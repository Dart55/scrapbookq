## 关于作者

本人乃Javascript新新新人一枚，看到javacript示例里满眼的promise、then()、()=>和其他各种奇奇怪怪的陌生玩意儿，不禁感动得热泪盈眶，再看一眼列出的单子：ES3、ES5、ES6、...那种无力感...怎一个酸爽了得。详见[在 2016 年学 JavaScript 是一种什么样的体验？](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/22782487)，请诸小白与我共飨

* 0.1.1 更新安装指南，改用initscrapbookq.py
* 0.1.0 第一个基本功能版本，发布时因为mozilla报警，临时删除了init.sh，安装指南文档没有及时更新，还是用init.sh
