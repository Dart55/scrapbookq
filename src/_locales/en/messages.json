Restart Firefox browser.\nIf it is Linux, I believe you will find the installation method in your own documentation.\nThe official website's introduction limits the number of words, cannot elaborate the installation step.\nhttps://github.com/tahama/scrapbookq/issues/\nImporting ScrapBook files requires modifying scrapbookq.conf file and configuring rdfpath properly. The path to the ScrapBook folder should be assigned to rdfpath, the Windows user needs to replace \\ with \\\\, and the end of the path also needs \\\\. For example, D:\\ScrapBook should be set to rdfpath = D:\\\\ScrapBook\\\\ . ScrapBook folder should have scrapbook.rdf file.",
